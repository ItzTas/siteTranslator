# siteTranslator

###### this is a personal project

it is a project that gets a site url and translates some of the tags of the same to a chosen language

it has a oriented interface you just need to run the server and put the url in the input field

###### limitations

it only translates p, li and td tags and only up to 8 translations of each due to the limitations in the resources

a site that can be a good exemple is https://blog.boot.dev just copy it and paste to the translator
